non-IoT.arff
------------
Contains only non-IoT file instances. It was used to check the confidence level of non-IoT instances when feeding them through a machine trained only with IoT instances

training-3month-without-feb.arff, testing-3month-without-feb.arff
------------------------------------------------------------------
This dataset contains 3 months of training data (1/10/2016 to 31/12/2016) and 3 month of testing data (1/1/2017 to 31/03/3017) of 17 IoT devices.
Please note that during this period, some days are identified as attack days and removed.
Attack days: attack_days = ['16-10-05','16-10-14','16-11-14','16-11-17','16-11-28','16-12-05','16-12-06','16-12-07','16-12-08','16-12-09','16-12-10','16-12-11','16-12-12','16-12-13','16-12-14','16-12-15','16-12-16','16-12-17','16-12-18','16-12-19','16-12-20','16-12-21','16-12-22','16-12-23','16-12-24','17-01-02','17-01-10','17-01-12','17-01-29','17-01-30','17-01-31','17-02-02','17-02-06','17-02-07','17-02-08','17-02-09','17-02-10','17-02-14','17-02-20','17-02-22','17-03-01','17-03-02','17-03-03','17-03-07','17-03-08','17-03-09','17-03-10','17-03-14','17-03-16','17-03-23','17-03-27']

training-3month-include-feb.arff, testing-3month-include-feb.arff
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This data set contains IOT only training data of 3 months + 2 weeks and remaining (3months - 3 weeks) of testing data.
Training data is covered from 1st of october to 31st of december and 12th of February to 25th of February.
Testing data is captured during the period from 1st of January to 31st of March excluding the 2 weeks in February covered during the training data.

Purpose of the file is Hp printer has change its behaviour in between 12th of Feb to 25th of Feb. Thats why we included this period into trainig file

Please note that during the 6 months period few days are identified as attack days and excluded from whole trace.
Please note those days: 
    attack_days = ['16-10-05','16-10-14','16-11-14','16-11-17','16-11-28','16-12-05','16-12-06','16-12-07','16-12-08','16-12-09','16-12-10','16-12-11','16-12-12','16-12-13','16-12-14','16-12-15','16-12-16','16-12-17','16-12-18','16-12-19','16-12-20','16-12-21','16-12-22','16-12-23','16-12-24','17-01-02','17-01-10','17-01-12','17-01-29','17-01-30','17-01-31','17-02-02','17-02-06','17-02-07','17-02-08','17-02-09','17-02-10','17-02-14','17-02-20','17-02-22','17-03-01','17-03-02','17-03-03','17-03-07','17-03-08','17-03-09','17-03-10','17-03-14','17-03-16','17-03-23','17-03-27']
